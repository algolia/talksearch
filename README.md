# TalkSearch

> Algolia no longer supports TalkSearch, but its individual components can
> be self-hosted by you to create the experience.

TalkSearch is a free tool provided by Algolia, to help conference organizers
showcase the awesome talks featured in their events.

TalkSearch is made of two parts: a [scraper][1], and an optional [front-end
library][2].

_Note that this repository holds the code of the TalkSearch documentation
website._
